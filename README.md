AWS-Sandbox
===========

This is me playing with aws.

If you want to run the examples yourself copy the `env.sample` to `.env`
and replace the placeholders with your actual AWS credentials.

Not for production use
----------------------

This is clearly not something one should consider *production ready*. So please
do not use this in production I wouldn't do it either.
